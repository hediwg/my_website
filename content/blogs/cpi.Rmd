This graphs is fine, but perhaps has too many sub-categories. You can find the [relative importance of components in the Consumer Price Indexes: U.S. city average, December 2020](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/tables/relative-importance/2020.htm) here. Can you choose a smaller subset of the components you have and only list the major categories (Housing, Transportation, Food and beverages, Medical care, Education and communication, Recreation, and Apparel), sorted according to their relative importance?

```{r}
importance_url <- "https://www.bls.gov/cpi/tables/relative-importance/2020.htm"


#get tables that exist on URL
tables_imp <- importance_url %>% 
  read_html() %>% 
  html_nodes(css="table")


# parse HTML tables into a dataframe called djia. 
# Use purr::map() to create a list of all tables in URL
importance <- map(tables_imp, . %>% 
               html_table(fill=TRUE)%>% 
               clean_names())
```
```{r}
importantnames <- c("Housing","Transportation","Food and Beverages", "Medical care", "Education and Communication", "Recreation" , "Apparel")

name_and_tickers <- names %>% 
  filter(name %in% importantnames)

name_and_tickers[2,"name"] <- "Food and beverages"
```

```{r}
imp_list <- importance[[1]][-1,] %>% 
  mutate(cpiu = as.numeric(u_s_city_average),
         cpiw = as.numeric(u_s_city_average_2)) %>%
  filter(item_and_group %in% name_and_tickers$name )%>%
  rename(name = item_and_group)

imp_list<- merge(x=imp_list,y=name_and_tickers,by="name")

imp_tickers <- imp_list%>%
select(symbol) %>% 
  pull()
  

imp_cpidatalist <- tq_get(imp_tickers, get = "economic.data", from =  "2000-01-01") %>% 

  # calculate yearly change in CPI by dividing current month by same month a year (or 12 months) earlier, minus 1
