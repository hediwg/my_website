<p>Your task is to produce two graphs of how life expectancy has changed over the years for the <code>country</code> and the <code>continent</code> you come from.</p>
<p>I have created the <code>country_data</code> and <code>continent_data</code> with the code below.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>country_data &lt;- gapminder %&gt;% 
            filter(country == &quot;China&quot;) 

continent_data &lt;- gapminder %&gt;% 
            filter(continent == &quot;Asia&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>First, create a plot of life expectancy over time for the single country you chose. Map <code>year</code> on the x-axis, and <code>lifeExp</code> on the y-axis. You should also use <code>geom_point()</code> to see the actual data points and <code>geom_smooth(se = FALSE)</code> to plot the underlying trendlines. You need to remove the comments <strong>#</strong> from the lines below for your code to run.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot1 &lt;- ggplot(data = country_data, mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp))+
geom_point()+
geom_smooth(se = FALSE)+
NULL
plot1</code></pre>
<pre><code>## `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;loess&#39; and formula &#39;y ~ x&#39;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/blogs/pre_programme_assignment_files/figure-html/lifeExp_one_country-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Next we need to add a title. Create a new plot, or extend plot1, using the <code>labs()</code> function to add an informative title to the plot.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot1&lt;- plot1 +
  labs(title = &quot;Life Expectancy Over Time in China&quot;,
      x = &quot;Year&quot;,
      y = &quot;Life Expectancy&quot;) +
  NULL


plot1</code></pre>
<pre><code>## `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;loess&#39; and formula &#39;y ~ x&#39;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/blogs/pre_programme_assignment_files/figure-html/lifeExp_one_country_with_label-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Secondly, produce a plot for all countries in the <em>continent</em> you come from. (Hint: map the <code>country</code> variable to the colour aesthetic. You also want to map <code>country</code> to the <code>group</code> aesthetic, so all points for each country are grouped together).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(continent_data, mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp , colour=country, group = country))+
   geom_point() + 
   geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
   NULL</code></pre>
<pre><code>## `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;loess&#39; and formula &#39;y ~ x&#39;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/blogs/pre_programme_assignment_files/figure-html/lifeExp_one_continent-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Finally, using the original <code>gapminder</code> data, produce a life expectancy over time graph, grouped (or faceted) by continent. We will remove all legends, adding the <code>theme(legend.position="none")</code> in the end of our ggplot.</p>
<pre class="r"><code> ggplot(data = gapminder , mapping = aes(x = year , y = lifeExp , colour= country))+
   geom_point() + 
   geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
   facet_wrap(~continent) +
   theme(legend.position=&quot;none&quot;) + 
   NULL</code></pre>
<pre><code>## `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;loess&#39; and formula &#39;y ~ x&#39;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/blogs/pre_programme_assignment_files/figure-html/lifeExp_facet_by_continent-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Given these trends, what can you say about life expectancy since 1952? Again, don’t just say what’s happening in the graph. Tell some sort of story and speculate about the differences in the patterns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Type your answer after this blockquote.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>The life expectancy has been increasing since 1952 in Americas, Europe, Oceania, most Asian countries and some African countries. But in some Middle Eastern countries and many African countries, life expectancy has decreased significantly since 1985.</p>
<p>The increasing life expectancy in most areas is easy to interpret: fewer infant death after the 1900s, and longer life span due to improvement in medicine, vaccines, and sanitary conditions worldwide.</p>
<p>However, the decrease of life expectancy in certain areas demonstrates that there is a very high inequality in how health was distributed across the world. The decrease in Middle Eastern countries like Iraq and Syria could be explained by wars and regional conflicts, such as the Gulf War, the Irap War, the Syrian Civil War, and the Arab Spring. In South Africa and Zimbabwe, however, <a href="https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/news/2009/11/21/life-expectancy-drops">The HIV/AIDS epidemic contributed to a 43 percent reduction in population growth between 2001 and 2008; a fall in birth rates also played a role</a>. Besides, the government social programmes fail to address the needs of tuberculosis, HIV, and AIDS patients and their children who become orphans.</p>

<h1>Task 3: Animal rescue incidents attended by the London Fire Brigade</h1>
<p><a href="https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/animal-rescue-incidents-attended-by-lfb">The London Fire Brigade</a> attends a range of non-fire incidents (which we call ‘special services’). These ‘special services’ include assistance to animals that may be trapped or in distress. The data is provided from January 2009 and is updated monthly. A range of information is supplied for each incident including some location information (postcode, borough, ward), as well as the data/time of the incidents. We do not routinely record data about animal deaths or injuries.</p>
<p>Please note that any cost included is a notional cost calculated based on the length of time rounded up to the nearest hour spent by Pump, Aerial and FRU appliances at the incident and charged at the current Brigade hourly rate.</p>

<p>Do you see anything strange in these tables?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> There are two rows for cats, one is Cat with 3736 counts and the other one is cat with 17 counts.</p>
<p>Finally, let us have a loot at the notional cost for rescuing each of these animals. As the LFB says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please note that any cost included is a notional cost calculated based on the length of time rounded up to the nearest hour spent by Pump, Aerial and FRU appliances at the incident and charged at the current Brigade hourly rate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is two things we will do:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Calculate the mean and median <code>incident_notional_cost</code> for each <code>animal_group_parent</code></li>
<li>Plot a boxplot to get a feel for the distribution of <code>incident_notional_cost</code> by <code>animal_group_parent</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Before we go on, however, we need to fix <code>incident_notional_cost</code> as it is stored as a <code>chr</code>, or character, rather than a number.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># what type is variable incident_notional_cost from dataframe `animal_rescue`
typeof(animal_rescue$incident_notional_cost)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;character&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># readr::parse_number() will convert any numerical values stored as characters into numbers
animal_rescue &lt;- animal_rescue %&gt;% 

  # we use mutate() to use the parse_number() function and overwrite the same variable
  mutate(incident_notional_cost = parse_number(incident_notional_cost))

# incident_notional_cost from dataframe `animal_rescue` is now &#39;double&#39; or numeric
typeof(animal_rescue$incident_notional_cost)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;double&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Now tht incident_notional_cost is numeric, let us quickly calculate summary statistics for each animal group.</p>

<p>Compare the mean and the median for each animal group. waht do you think this is telling us?
Anything else that stands out? Any outliers?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>According to the plot and linear fit generated by the code below, there appears a positive relationship between the mean and the median of notional cost for rescuing each animal group, since most points lie within the confidence intervals and there is a positive slope of the fitted line. This makes sense since the mean and the median are both reflecting the “average” cost of saving a group of animal.</p>
<p>The Horse and Cow groups definitely stand out since their mean and median are both much larger than others, and their data points lie in the upper right corner of the line.</p>
<p>Unknown - Heavy Livestock Animal is an obvious outlier. Its mean cost is too high relative to the low median cost compared with other groups. A possible reason could be that there are few times when saving these heavy livestock animal cost a lot, but most of the time the cost is low, and the mean is driven up by the few high costs.</p>
<p>Squirrel, Ferret, and Rabbit are also outliers at the 95% confidence level. Their medians are too high relative to their means. This is possibly because their rescue cost is high most of the times because they move fast and hard to catch, but was extremely low one or two times, which draws the level down.</p>

<p>Which of these four graphs do you think best communicates the variability of the <code>incident_notional_cost</code> values? Also, can you please tell some sort of story (which animals are more expensive to rescue than others, the spread of values) and speculate about the differences in the patterns.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Common examples of measures of statistical dispersion are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_dispersion">the variance, standard deviation, and interquartile range</a>. I think that these features are best illustrated by the boxplot, because it displays the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum of the data, besides, it demonstrates the symmetry, Skewness, and outliers for a normal distribution.</p>
<p>Horses and cows are more expensive to rescue than others since their distributions are centered around 740 and 634 and heavily skewed to the right, whic mean that thier entire distribution are more tilted to the expensive side than other groups.</p>
<p>The spread of values in the distribution of cows, ferrets, and rabbits are larger than others, possibly because they are rescued for fewer times than other groups according to the variable <code>count</code>. Therefore, the data could be less stable, and the rescuers could lack experience so the situations of rescue varies a lot and there is no pattern found of the animals’ action.</p>
<p>The cost distribution of dogs and foxes are similar, centered around 350 with similar spreads and tilted to the right. This makes sense because they are relatives: they are both canidae and have similar behavior. Distribution of ferrets and rabbits, hamsters and squirrels, etc. also exhibit similar patterns for the same reason. The statistical spread of the distribution of birds, deer, dogs, cats, and foxes is small, possibly because their behavior is well studied and the rescue process is well standardized, and the cost won’t vary a lot. In contrast, animals that are rarely rescued like ferrets and cows are rescued with cost varying a lot each time.</p>
