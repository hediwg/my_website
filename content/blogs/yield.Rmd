# Challenge 1: Yield Curve inversion

Every so often, we hear warnings from commentators on the "inverted yield curve" and its predictive power with respect to recessions. An explainer what a [inverted yield curve is can be found here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-yieldcurve-explainer/explainer-what-is-an-inverted-yield-curve-idUSKBN1O50GA). If you'd rather listen to something, here is a great podcast from [NPR on yield curve indicators](https://www.podbean.com/media/share/dir-4zgj9-6aefd11)

In addition, many articles and commentators think that, e.g., [*Yield curve inversion is viewed as a harbinger of recession*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-14/u-k-yield-curve-inverts-for-first-time-since-financial-crisis). One can always doubt whether inversions are truly a harbinger of recessions, and [use the attached parable on yield curve inversions](https://twitter.com/5_min_macro/status/1161627360946511873).


In our case we will look at US data and use the [FRED database](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) to download historical yield curve rates, and plot the yield curves since 1999 to see when the yield curves flatten. If you want to know more, a very nice article that explains the [yield curve is and its inversion can be found here](https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2018/10/the-data-behind-the-fear-of-yield-curve-inversions/). 
First, we will load the yield curve data file that contains data on the yield curve since 1960-01-01

```{r download_historical_yield_curve, warning=FALSE}

yield_curve <- read_csv(here::here("data", "yield_curve.csv"))

glimpse(yield_curve)
```

## Plotting the yield curve

producing the following three plots

### Yields on US rates by duration since 1960

```{r}
yield_curve  %>% 
  mutate(duration=factor(duration, levels=c("3-Month Treasury Bill", "6-Month Treasury Bill","1-Year Treasury Rate","2-Year Treasury Rate","3-Year Treasury Rate","5-Year Treasury Rate","7-Year Treasury Rate","10-Year Treasury Rate","20-Year Treasury Rate","30-Year Treasury Rate"))) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=value, color=duration)) +
  geom_line()+
  facet_wrap(~ duration, ncol=2)+
  labs(title="Yields on U.S. Treasury rates since 1960",
       y="Yield(%)",
       x="Date",
       caption="Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)")+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position="none")

```


### Monthly yields on US rates by duration since 1999 on a year-by-year basis


```{r}
yield_curve_2 <- yield_curve  %>%
  mutate(year=factor(year(date)), 
         maturity=factor(maturity, levels=c("3m", "6m","1y","2y","3y","5y","7y","10y","20y","30y")))

yield_curve_2 %>%
  filter(date>="1999-01-01") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=maturity, y=value, group=date, color=year)) +
  geom_line()+
  facet_wrap(~ year, ncol=4)+
  labs(title="U.S. yield curve",
       y="Yield(%)",
       x="Maturity",
       caption="Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)")+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position="none")

```


### 3-month and 10-year yields since 1999

```{r treasury_rates}

yield_curve_3 <- yield_curve %>% 
  filter(date>="1999-01-01", maturity =="3m" | maturity =="10y") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=value, color=duration, group=maturity))+
  geom_line()+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.title=element_blank())+
  labs(title="Yields on 3-Month and 10-Year U.S. Treasury Rates since 1999",
       y="Yield(%)",
       x="Date",
       caption="Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)")
yield_curve_3
```


According to [Wikipedia's list of recession in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States), since 1999 there have been two recession in the US: between Mar 2001–Nov 2001 and between Dec 2007–June 2009. Does the yield curve seem to flatten before these recessions? Can a yield curve flattening really mean a recession is coming in the US? Since 1999, when did short-term (3 months) yield more than longer term (10 years) debt?



- For the first, the code below creates a dataframe with all US recessions since 1946

```{r setup_US-recessions, warning=FALSE}

# get US recession dates after 1946 from Wikipedia 
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States

recessions <- tibble(
  from = c("1948-11-01", "1953-07-01", "1957-08-01", "1960-04-01", "1969-12-01", "1973-11-01", "1980-01-01","1981-07-01", "1990-07-01", "2001-03-01", "2007-12-01","2020-02-01"),  
  to = c("1949-10-01", "1954-05-01", "1958-04-01", "1961-02-01", "1970-11-01", "1975-03-01", "1980-07-01", "1982-11-01", "1991-03-01", "2001-11-01", "2009-06-01", "2020-04-30") 
  )  %>% 
  mutate(From = ymd(from), 
         To=ymd(to),
         duration_days = To-From)

recessions
```

```{r}
yield_curve_spread <- yield_curve %>%
  select(date, maturity, value)%>%
  filter(maturity == "3m" | maturity == "10y")%>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = maturity, values_from = value)

colnames(yield_curve_spread) <- c("date", "three_month", "ten_year")

yield_curve_spread <- yield_curve_spread%>%
  mutate(diff = ten_year - three_month)

recessions_1 <- recessions %>%
  filter(year(From) >= 1960)

```

```{r}
#graph 

ggplot(yield_curve_spread, aes(x = date, y = diff)) +
  geom_line(size = 0.1)+
  geom_hline(yintercept=0)+
  theme_minimal(base_size = 7) +

  annotate("rect", xmin = recessions_1$From, xmax = recessions_1$To, 
           ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf, alpha = 0.1)+
  labs(title="Yield Curve Inveresion: 10-year minus 3-month U.S.Treasury Rates",
       subtitle = "Difference in % points, monthly average 
Shaded areas correspond to recessions",
       y="Difference (10 year - 3 month) yield in %",
       x=NULL,
