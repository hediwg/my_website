The life expectancy has been increasing since 1952 in Americas, Europe, Oceania, most Asian countries and some African countries. But in some Middle Eastern countries and many African countries, life expectancy has decreased significantly since 1985. 

The increasing life expectancy in most areas is easy to interpret: fewer infant death after the 1900s, and longer life span due to improvement in medicine, vaccines, and sanitary conditions worldwide. 

However, the decrease of life expectancy in certain areas demonstrates that there is a very high inequality in how health was distributed across the world. The decrease in Middle Eastern countries like Iraq and Syria could be explained by wars and regional conflicts, such as the Gulf War, the Irap War, the Syrian Civil War, and the Arab Spring. In South Africa and Zimbabwe, however, [The HIV/AIDS epidemic contributed to a 43 percent reduction in population growth between 2001 and 2008; a fall in birth rates also played a role](https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/news/2009/11/21/life-expectancy-drops). Besides, the government social programmes fail to address the needs of tuberculosis, HIV, and AIDS patients and their children who become orphans.




#Animal rescue incidents attended by the London Fire Brigade

[The London Fire Brigade](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/animal-rescue-incidents-attended-by-lfb) attends a range of non-fire incidents (which we call 'special services'). These 'special services' include assistance to animals that may be trapped or in distress. The data is provided from January 2009 and is updated monthly. A range of information is supplied for each incident including some location information (postcode, borough, ward), as well as the data/time of the incidents. We do not routinely record data about animal deaths or injuries.


```{r load_animal_rescue_data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/animal-rescue-incidents-attended-by-lfb/8a7d91c2-9aec-4bde-937a-3998f4717cd8/Animal%20Rescue%20incidents%20attended%20by%20LFB%20from%20Jan%202009.csv"

animal_rescue <- read_csv(url,
                          locale = locale(encoding = "CP1252")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()


glimpse(animal_rescue)
```


```{r, instances_by_calendar_year}

animal_rescue %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(cal_year) %>% 
  summarise(count=n())

animal_rescue %>% 
  count(cal_year, name="count")

```



```{r, animal_group_percentages}
animal_rescue %>% 
  group_by(animal_group_parent) %>% 
  
  #group_by and summarise will produce a new column with the count in each animal group
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  
  # mutate adds a new column; here we calculate the percentage
  mutate(percent = round(100*count/sum(count),2)) %>% 
  
  # arrange() sorts the data by percent. Since the default sorting is min to max and we would like to see it sorted
  # in descending order (max to min), we use arrange(desc()) 
  arrange(desc(percent))


animal_rescue %>% 
  
  #count does the same thing as group_by and summarise
  # name = "count" will call the column with the counts "count" ( exciting, I know)
  # and 'sort=TRUE' will sort them from max to min
  count(animal_group_parent, name="count", sort=TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(percent = round(100*count/sum(count),2))

```

Do you see anything strange in these tables? 
There are two rows for cats, one is Cat with 3736 counts and the other one is cat with 17 counts.

Finally, let us have a loot at the notional cost for rescuing each of these animals. As the LFB says,


Before we go on, however, we need to fix `incident_notional_cost` as it is stored as a `chr`, or character, rather than a number.

```{r, parse_incident_cost,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# what type is variable incident_notional_cost from dataframe `animal_rescue`
typeof(animal_rescue$incident_notional_cost)

# readr::parse_number() will convert any numerical values stored as characters into numbers
animal_rescue <- animal_rescue %>% 

  # we use mutate() to use the parse_number() function and overwrite the same variable
  mutate(incident_notional_cost = parse_number(incident_notional_cost))

# incident_notional_cost from dataframe `animal_rescue` is now 'double' or numeric
typeof(animal_rescue$incident_notional_cost)

```


```{r, stats_on_incident_cost,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

animal_rescue %>% 
  
  # group by animal_group_parent
  group_by(animal_group_parent) %>% 
  
  # filter resulting data, so each group has at least 6 observations
  filter(n()>6) %>% 
  
  # summarise() will collapse all values into 3 values: the mean, median, and count  
  # we use na.rm=TRUE to make sure we remove any NAs, or cases where we do not have the incident cos
  summarise(mean_incident_cost = mean (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            median_incident_cost = median (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            sd_incident_cost = sd (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            min_incident_cost = min (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            max_incident_cost = max (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            count = n()) %>% 
  
  # sort the resulting data in descending order. You choose whether to sort by count or mean cost.
  arrange(desc(mean_incident_cost))

```


According to the plot and linear fit generated by the code below, there appears a positive relationship between the mean and the median of notional cost for rescuing each animal group, since most points lie within the confidence intervals and there is a positive slope of the fitted line. This makes sense since the mean and the median are both reflecting the “average” cost of saving a group of animal. 

The Horse and Cow groups definitely stand out since their mean and median are both much larger than others, and their data points lie in the upper right corner of the line. 

Unknown - Heavy Livestock Animal is an obvious outlier. Its mean cost is too high relative to the low median cost compared with other groups. A possible reason could be that there are few times when saving these heavy livestock animal cost a lot, but most of the time the cost is low, and the mean is driven up by the few high costs. 

Squirrel, Ferret, and Rabbit are also outliers at the 95% confidence level. Their medians are too high relative to their means. This is possibly because their rescue cost is high most of the times because they move fast and hard to catch, but was extremely low one or two times, which draws the level down.

```{r}

animal_rescue_sum <- animal_rescue %>% 
  
  # group by animal_group_parent
  group_by(animal_group_parent) %>% 
  
  # filter resulting data, so each group has at least 6 observations
  filter(n()>6) %>% 
  
  # summarise() will collapse all values into 3 values: the mean, median, and count  
  # we use na.rm=TRUE to make sure we remove any NAs, or cases where we do not have the incident cos
  summarise(mean_incident_cost = mean (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            median_incident_cost = median (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            sd_incident_cost = sd (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            min_incident_cost = min (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            max_incident_cost = max (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            count = n()) %>% 
  
  # sort the resulting data in descending order. You choose whether to sort by count or mean cost.
  arrange(desc(mean_incident_cost))

ggplot(animal_rescue_sum, aes(x = median_incident_cost, y = mean_incident_cost)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.3) +
  
  # add a smoothing line, and use method="lm" to get the best straight-line
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
  
  # use a white background and frame the plot with a black box
  theme_bw() +
  
  labs(title = "Relationship Between the mean and the median of notional cost for rescuing each animal group", subtitle = "Scatterplot with Linear Best fit",
      x = "median",
      y = "mean") +
  
  NULL
```

Finally, let us plot a few plots that show the distribution of incident_cost for each animal group.

```{r, plots_on_incident_cost_by_animal_group,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# base_plot
base_plot <- animal_rescue %>% 
  group_by(animal_group_parent) %>% 
  filter(n()>6) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=incident_notional_cost))+
  facet_wrap(~animal_group_parent, scales = "free")+
  theme_bw()

base_plot + geom_histogram()
base_plot + geom_density()
base_plot + geom_boxplot()
base_plot + stat_ecdf(geom = "step", pad = FALSE) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)



```


Common examples of measures of statistical dispersion are [the variance, standard deviation, and interquartile range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_dispersion). I think that these features are best illustrated by the boxplot, because it displays the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum of the data, besides, it demonstrates the symmetry, Skewness, and outliers for a normal distribution.

Horses and cows are more expensive to rescue than others since their distributions are centered around 740 and 634 and heavily skewed to the right, whic mean that thier entire distribution are more tilted to the expensive side than other groups.

The spread of values in the distribution of cows, ferrets, and rabbits are larger than others, possibly because they are rescued for fewer times than other groups according to the variable `count`. Therefore, the data could be less stable, and the rescuers could lack experience so the situations of rescue varies a lot and there is no pattern found of the animals' action.

The cost distribution of dogs and foxes are similar, centered around 350 with similar spreads and tilted to the right. This makes sense because they are relatives: they are both canidae and have similar behavior. Distribution of ferrets and rabbits, hamsters and squirrels, etc. also exhibit similar patterns for the same reason. The statistical spread of the distribution of birds, deer, dogs, cats, and foxes is small, possibly because their behavior is well studied and the rescue process is well standardized, and the cost won't vary a lot. In contrast, animals that are rarely rescued like ferrets and cows are rescued with cost varying a lot each time.
